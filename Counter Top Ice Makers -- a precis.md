# Counter Top Ice Makers 
## -- a precis by E.C. Errickson

### Overview
---
Most of the widely available base model consumer makers share the following characteristics:
1. They are all almost identical mechanically, being made from the exact same Chinese PCBs and compressors. (*I looked at a lot of them.*) Price range is ~ $100 to $130.
2. They make "bullet" ice, **not crushed**. Making crushed means adding a grinder and additional motor and that puts the prices all well north of $250.
3. They make ice very quickly in small batches: ~ 6-7 minutes for each batch of nine 2mmx3mm hollow cubes, or about a pound an hour. They are not meant to run completely unattended as you have to empty the ice bucket when it gets full.
4. For crushed ice, you would need a Lewis bag (~ $20) or a manual crusher (~ $30).
